Spreadsheet/BasicReadNamedCol version 1.03
==========================================

Provides methods for simple reading of a Excel spreadsheet row
at a time returning the row as an array of column values.
Properties can be set so that blank rows are skipped.

There are a number of other properties that can be set.
The aim is to make reading from Excel spreadsheets as
easy as processing a text file

The *KEY* feature of this module is the ability to define
the order in which you want to see the columns without regard
to the actual order in the spreadsheet.
